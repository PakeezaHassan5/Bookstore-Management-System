# Bookstore-Management-System
The Bookstore Management System is designed to streamline and automate core bookstore operations for improved efficiency and customer service. It manages book inventory by tracking details like title, author, genre, ISBN, publisher, publication year, and stock availability. The system also maintains comprehensive customer records, including contact information and addresses, ensuring smooth order processing and personalized service. Orders are efficiently handled by linking customers, books, and employees, while publishers and suppliers are recorded to simplify restocking and communication. 
Additionally, employee records track roles, hire dates, salaries, and responsibilities, distinguishing between managers with bonuses and cashiers with shifts. By organizing books into genres and associating them with authors and publishers, the system supports easy navigation and quick access to information. Overall, it provides a structured database framework that centralizes all bookstore activities, from sales and staff management to supplier coordination.
